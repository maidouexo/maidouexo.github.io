### title:
**Genomic instability and aging-like phenotype in the absence of mammalian SIRT6**

  Frederick W. Alt
  Cell 124, 315–329, January 27, 2006

### key words:
- SIRT6
- genomic instability
- base excision repair

### summary:
 SIRT6 is a nuclear, chromatin-associated protein that promotes resistance to DNA damage and suppresses genomic instability in mouse cells, in association with a role in base excision repair (BER). SIRT6-deﬁcient mice are small and at 2–3 weeks of age develop abnormalities that include profound lymphopenia, loss of subcutaneous fat, lordokyphosis, and severe metabolic defects, eventually dying at about 4 weeks. one function of SIRT6 is to promote normal DNA repair, and that SIRT6 loss leads to abnormalities in mice that overlap with aging-associated degenerative processes.

### notes:
**SIRT6 Is a Nuclear Protein Expressed in Many Different Tissues**
>* immunostaining mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with an anti-SIRT6 antibody and human HT1080 cells into which we retrovirally transduced a FLAG-tagged SIRT6 protein
>* Analysis of SIRT6 RNA and protein revealed SIRT6 expression in most mouse tissues
>* Isolated nuclei were separated into nucleoplasmic and chromatin/nuclear matrix subfractions, and SIRT6 protein detected by Western analysis.

**Impaired Proliferation and IR Sensitivity of SIRT6-Deﬁcient MEFs and ES Cells**
>* SIRT6-deﬁcient embryonic stem (ES) cells by replacing SIRT6 with a LacZ gene ntroduced in frame into the exon 1
>* Appropriately targeted ES cells were conﬁrmed by Southern blotting ， and used to generate mice heterozygous for the SIRT6-inactivating mutation (referred to as SIRT6 +/-)
>* We also generated SIRT6 -/-ES cells via the high G418-selection method; We also analyzed SIRT6 +/- mice for bGal staining and conﬁrmed expression of lacZ from the SIRT6 promoter in most issues

**Genomic Instability in SIRT6-Deﬁcient Cells**
```
• DAPI stain
• Spectral karyotype analysis
• Q-FISH stain
```

**SIRT6-Deﬁcient Cells Possess Intact Checkpoint Responses, End-Joining, and DSB Repair Pathways**
>* Cells were irradiated with a range of doses and collected following BrdU labeling or staining with anti-phospho H3, to assess the G1/S and the G2/M checkpoints

**SIRT6 Functions in Base Excision Repair**
>* SIRT6 Deﬁciency Compromises the BER Pathway
>* SIRT6 Deﬁciency-Induced Hypersensitivity Is Rescued by Overexpression of the dRP Lyase Domain of Polb
>* Normal Expression of BER Factors and Efﬁcient Formation of XRCC1 and PAR Foci in SIRT6-Deﬁcient Cells

**SIRT6-Deﬁcient Mice Suffer from an Acute, Lethal Degenerative Phenotype**


**SIRT6-/-Mice Exhibited Non-Cell-Autonomous Defects in Lymphocytes and Severe Metabolic Defects**
