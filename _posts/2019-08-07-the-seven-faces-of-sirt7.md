**The seven faces of SIRT7**

  Maximilian F. Blank & Ingrid Grummt (2017): The seven faces of SIRT7, Transcription, DOI: 10.1080/21541264.2016.1276658

### notes :
**SIRT7 promotes pre-rRNA transcription and processing**
>* SIRT7 is enriched in nucleoli, where it facilitates RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-dependent transcription of RNA genes (rDNA) by interacting with the transcription factor UBF and the Pol I subunit PAF53 (polymerase-associated factor 53), the mammalian homolog of the yeast Pol Isubunit A49
>* Wnt5a was found to trigger nucleolar accumulation of Dishevelled 1 (DVL1), a tumor suppressor that binds to rDNA. Increased levels of DVL1 displace SIRT7 from rDNA, hence repressing Pol I transcription
>* Deacetylation by SIRT7, facilitates the interaction of U3–55k with U3 snoRNA, thus promoting pre-rRNA cleavage

**SIRT7 regulates transcription of all three nuclear RNA polymerases**
>* SIRT7 interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes, such as B-WICH, NoRC and SWI/SNF
>* SIRT7 was found to interact with the Pol III-speciﬁc transcription factor TFIIIC2 and to occupy genes that are transcribed by Pol III
>* SIRT7 promotes the release of P-TEFb from the inactive 7SK snRNP complex and deacetylates CDK9
>* SIRT7 has been reported to be recruited by speciﬁc transcription factors, e.g., ELK4 and Myc, to eacetylate lysine 18 of histone H3 (H3K18), hypoacetylation of H3K18 compromising transcription of speciﬁc target genes
>* Both desuccinylation of H3K122 and deacetylation of H3K18 result in chromatin compaction and lead to transcription inhibition

**SIRT7 maintains metabolic homeostasis**
>* SIRT7→Myc→repress ER stress and prevent fatty liver disease
>* SIRT7→deacetylation of GABPβ1→mitochondrial disease
>* SIRT7→negatively HIF1α and HIF2α

**SIRT7 attenuates cellular stress**
>* SIRT7→hyperacetylation of  PAF53→downregulation of POI Ⅰtranscription
