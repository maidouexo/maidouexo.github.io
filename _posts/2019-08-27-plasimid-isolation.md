### theory:
**Alkaline Lysis:**
> Alkaline lysis is a method used in molecular biology , to isolate plasmid DNA or other cell components such as proteins by breaking the cells open. Bacteria containing the plasmid of interest is first grown, and then allowed to lyse with an alkaline lysis buffer consisting of a detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and a strong base sodium hydroxide. The detergent cleaves the phospholipid bilayer of  membrane and the alkali denatures the proteins which are involved in maintaining the structure of the cell membrane. Through a series of steps involving agitation, precipitation, centrifugation, and the removal of supernatant, cellular debris is removed and the plasmid is isolated and purified.

**Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate:**
> Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (C12H25SO4Na) or sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)  is an anionic surfactant. It is a  molecule having a tail of 12 carbon atoms, attached to a sulfate group.  This sulfate group provide the amphiphilic properties (required for a detergent) to the molecule.
> SDS has not been proven to be carcinogenic when either applied directly to skin or consumed. It has however been shown to irritate the skin of the face with prolonged exposure of more than an hour. Proteins are contaminating agents in any type of DNA isolation so as in plasmid DNA isolation also. They can interfere with the final product and result with low yield. SDS is used to denature the proteins and facilitate the DNA purification process.
> Agarose gel electrophoresis is a powerful separation method frequently used to analyze plasmid DNA. The microscopic pores  present in agarose gels act as a molecular sieve. Samples of DNA can be loaded into wells made in the gel during molding. When an electric field is applied, the DNA molecules are separated by the pores in the gel according to their size and shape. Generally, smaller molecules pass through the pores more easily than larger ones. Since DNA has a strong negative charge, it will migrate towards the positive electrode in the electrophoresis apparatus. The rate at which a given DNA molecule migrates through the gel depends not only on its size and shape, but also on the type of electrophoresis buffer, the gel concentration and the applied voltage. Under the conditions that will be used for this experiment, the different forms of the same plasmid DNA molecule have the following rates of migration (in decreasing order): Super coiled > linear > Nicked Circles >dimer > trimer > etc.

### kit:
TIANpure Midi plasmid kit (cat.no.DP107)

### procedure:
>* 1.Column equilibration: Place a spin column CP4 in a clean collection tube,and add 500ul buffer BL to CP4.Centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 rpm (13,400 ×g) in a table-top centrifuge. Discard the fle-through, and set the spin column CP4 back into the collection tube.
>* 2.Harvest 5-15 ml bacterial cells in a centrifuge tube by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in a conventional, table-top centrifuge for 1 min at room tempreture,then remove tube until all medium has been drained.
>* 3.Re-suspend pelleted bacterial cells in 500 ul buffer P1. Enshure that RNase Ahas been added to buffer P1. No cell clumps should be visible after re-suspension of the pellet.
>* 4.Add 500 ul buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 8 times. Do not vortex. Do not allow lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min.
>* 5.Add 700 ul buffer P3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 8 times. The solution should become cloudy.
>* 6.centrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. A compact white pellet will form.
>* 7.Carefully transfer the supernatants from step 6 to filtration column CS. Centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000 rpm.
>* 8.transfer the flow-through in the collection tube to the spin column CP4 by decanting. Centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 rpm. Discard the flow-through and set the spin column CP4 back into the collection tube. Repeat the step 7-8 until all the supernatants are filtred.
>* 9.Wash the spin column CP4 by adding 500ul buffer PD and centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 rpm. Discard the flow-through and set the spin column CP4 back into the collection tube.
>* 10.Wash the spin column CP4 by adding 600ul buffer PW and centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 rpm. Discard the flow-through and set the spin column CP4 back into the collection tube.
>* 11.Repeat step 10 again. Centrifuge for an additional 2 min at 12,000 rpm to remove residual wash buffer PW and then open CP4 lid and stay at room tempreture for 2 min.
>* 12.Place the spin column CP4 in a clean 1.5ml centrifuge tube. Add 100ul MQ water to the center of the spin column CP4, let stand for 10 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 rpm. Repeat this step to increase plasmid recovery efficiency. Store at -20℃.
