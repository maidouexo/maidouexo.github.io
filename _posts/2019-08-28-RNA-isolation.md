### Principle:
> RNA (Ribonucleic acid) is a polymeric substance present in living cells and many viruses, consisting of a long single-stranded chain of phosphate and ribose units with the  nitrogen bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil, which are bonded to the ribose sugar. RNA is used in all the steps of protein synthesis in all living cells and carries the genetic information for many viruses.
> The isolation of RNA with high quality is a crucial step required to perform various molecular biology experiment. TRIzol Reagent is a ready-to-use reagent used for RNA isolation from cells and tissues.TRIzol works by maintaining RNA integrity during tissue homogenization, while at the same time disrupting and breaking down cells and cell components. Addition  of  chloroform, after the centrifugation, separates the solution  into  aqueous and organic phases. RNA  remains only in  the  aqueous  phase.
> After transferring the aqueous phase, RNA can be recovered by precipitation with isopropyl alcohol. But the DNA and proteins can recover by sequential separation after the removal of aqueous phase. Precipitation with ethanol requires DNA from the interphase, and an additional precipitation with isopropyl alcohol requires proteins from the organic phase. Total RNA extracted by TRIzol Reagent is free from the contamination of protein and DNA. This RNA can be used in Northern blot analysis, in vitro translation, poly (A) selection, RNase protection  assay, and molecular cloning.


### Procedure:
> 1.  Determine your sample type, and perform homogenization at room temperature according to the table below. The sample volume should not exceed 10% of the volume of TRIzol Reagent used for homogenization. Be sure to use the indicated amount of TRIzol Reagent, because an insufficient volume can result in DNA contamination of isolated RNA.
> 2.  Incubate the homogenized sample for 5 minutes at room temperature to permit complete dissociation of the nucleoprotein complex.
> 3.  Add 0.2 mL of chloroform per 1 mL of TRIzol® Reagent used for homogenization. Cap the tube securely. Shake tube vigorously by hand for 15 seconds. Incubate for 2–3 minutes at room temperature.
> 4.  Centrifuge the sample at 12,000 × g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Note: The mixture separates into a lower red phenolchloroform phase, an interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase. The upper aqueous phase is ~50% of the total volume.
> 5.  Place the aqueous phase into a new tube Add 0.5 mL of 100% isopropanol to the aqueous phase, per 1 mL of TRIzol® Reagent used for homogenization. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
> 6.  Centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Note: The RNA is often invisible prior to centrifugation, and forms a gel-like pellet on the side and bottom of the tube.
> 7.  Remove the supernatant from the tube, leaving only the RNA pellet.Wash the pellet, with 1 mL of 75% ethanol per 1 mL of TRIzol® Reagent used in the initial homogenization. Vortex the sample briefly, then centrifuge the tube at 7500 × g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Discard the wash.
> 8.  Air dry the RNA pellet for 5–10 minutes. Resuspend the RNA pellet in DEPC water (20–50 μL) by passing the solution up and down several times through a pipette tip .Note: Do not allow the RNA to dry completely, because the pellet can lose solubility. Incubate in a water bath or heat block set at 55–60°C for 10–15 minutes to fully dissolved RNA samples.
